an ArcGIS Server site is as follows:</p><p id="GUID-4DC817AC-A8BD-4971-8962-E13BA4A358A6"><span class="usertext">http://&lt;host&gt;:/arcgis/rest/services</span></p><p id="GUID-0E960E93-2678-4245-8F87-9B2D8EB651C2">For example, to get to the root directory of ArcGIS Online services, the URL is as follows:

resources to the clients, for the sake of simplicity, the resources
of the ArcGIS REST API are divided into two types: resources and
operations. For more information, see <a class="xref" rel="02ss/02ss00000053000000.htm" href="02ss/02ss00000053000000.html">Resources and operations</a>.</p><p id="GUID-5C879E75-B61E-4196-968B-2D4620E15294">The supported service types that include operations are map,
